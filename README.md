# ExtronDMPController
Control of an Extron DMP
<br>
This started because I had collected some radio microphones and some Extron DMP units. However, I needed an actual mixer to fade the microphones in and out. Oh, I also had a spare touchscreen monitor and PC kicking around. So, being an Extron Authorised Programmer, I have access to the Control Script modules, which include (most of) the control commands.<br>
<br>
I say most of, because there are some that are not published...so, I employed WireShark while running Extron DSP Configurator to figure out the commands I needed (i.e., the labels for each input and output).<br>
<br>
Then this project was born. Still to be tested using the touchscreen, but looks good so far.<br>
